            - birthday
            - preferred_payment_method
            - default_split_percentage
        - when creating a tab, if no amount is specified, tab is split using default_split_percentage
        - If any sender does not have a default split percentage, amounts are required
        - If amount is specified for one sender, all senders must have an amount
        - Run validation,
            - if invalid, notify user, bring back up modal
    - Tabs
        - tab metadata

    - user_tab_map
        - maps individual users with individual tabs
        - breaks down individual user balances owed on tabs
    -user_tab_payment_status
        - view
        - Used to calculate if a user has paid off a tab
        - this allows the user_tab_map to be update only
        - If user makes overpayment, payment will not have tabid
    - user_tab_payments_view
        - Track payments to tab
        - If payment applies, tabid is set
        - If payment is more than tab amount, tabid is none
        - Can filter where tabid is none to get overpayments
    - user_payments (?)
        - Insert only table for each payment made
        - Maybe used for accounting?
            - Allows the tracking of balances overtime       
    - events
        - logging table

  - Make another view, overpayments, to select from the above where remaining > 0
- NOTE: JUST SUM UP PAYMENTS BY TAB AND SUB AMOUNT OWED BY TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO GET TOTAL PAYMENT
- DON'T NEED THE WINDOW (BUT CAN KEEP IT FOR TRACKING-)
